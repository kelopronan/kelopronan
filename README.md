## 🧠 About Me

Currently designing a story-focused action game inspired by cinematic storytelling and precision melee combat. The project is in pre-production and team-building phase while I finish my board exams; full development will begin after.

Primary focus areas:

Game design & narrative systems

Combat mechanics (Unreal Engine / C++)

Long-term worldbuilding & scalable architecture

Looking to collaborate with developers, artists, and sound designers who enjoy building strong foundations before rushing production.

I'm a curious and determined 12th Grader, currently prepping for the **SAT** while diving deep into programming. I thrive on understanding systems from the ground up and enjoy writing code that’s not just functional — but meaningful.

- 🧩 Love solving logical problems  
- 💬 Believe in building strong fundamentals  
- 📚 Planning my undergrad in India, followed by a master's in the US  
- ⚡ Code clean, stay consistent, improve every day
